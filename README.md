# Hacky_Racers_Starting_lights
Code for an arduino or microcontroller to mimic a relay board to work with fsrace software.

Original relay board documentation: http://www.dlpdesign.com/usb/dlp-ior4-ds-v13.pdf

Any relay board can be used with the microcotnroller, I'm using one of these: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lysignal-Channel-Interface-Optocoupler-Protection/dp/B073W6QD9P/
